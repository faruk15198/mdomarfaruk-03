                    <p id="peragraph">The name of the author is very important to protect the copyright of the document. The name of the author can be an organisational name. This means that the copyright is owned by the organisation rather than an individual. It is always amazing as a teacher to receive documents that have no author named.

Creators of documents should consider that readers will print, disassemble, reassemble, staple, sort and file the document. There is always a chance that pages can be in the wrong order, or not belonging to the same document, or lost. For these reasons, page numbering and document title is always recommended.

Other above-listed headers and footers are optional but can be very helpful. The date of publication not only helps to establish copyright but also helps the author to know which version is the most current.</p>
